## Directories

The directories are organized as follows:

* hg-noise-injector - A module to inject realistic errors in the training process
* low-level-fault-injection - Configuration files for NVBITFI for fault injection
* pytorch-scripts - PyTorch scripts for training and inference for the 
used DNNs. For for information read the [README](/pytorch_scripts/README.md).
