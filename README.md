## Directories

The directories are organized as follows:

* hg_noise_injector - A module to inject realistic errors in the training process
* eval_fault_injection_cfg - Configuration files for NVBITFI for fault injection
* pytorch_scripts - PyTorch scripts for training and inference for the 
used DNNs. For information read the [README](/pytorch_scripts/README.md).
